       `base64 --decode acsp_client_credentials.uue > acsp_client_credentials.tar`
5. Extract the client credentials file with the following command:
       `tar xf acsp_client_credentials.tar`
6. Move the `server-config` files into the default place with the following command:
       `mv server-config/* ./`
7. Rename the client credentials file with the following command:
       `mv acsp.properties.client acsp.properties`
8. (Optional:) Change group ID of the files with the following command:
       `chown root.pkcs11 *`
9. Enable ACSP to use the proper config for the service instance in the cloud:
       `export ACSP_P11=/opt/ibm/acsp-pkcs11-client/config/acsp.properties` -->

<!-- Now your ACSP client is operational and your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} is ready to use!
