# Managing security and compliance with {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}
{: #manage-security-compliance}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} is integrated with the
{{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to help you manage security and
compliance for your organization.
{: shortdesc}

<!---Eliminate "Monitor for controls and goals" line in prod--->

With the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, you can:

* Monitor for controls and goals that pertain to {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
* Define rules for {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} that can help
  to standardize resource configuration.

<!---Eliminate following two sections in prod--->
## Monitoring security and compliance posture with {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}
{: #monitor-crypto}

As a security or compliance focal, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} [goals](#x2117978){: term} to help ensure that your organization is adhering to the external and internal standards for your industry. By using the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to validate the resource configurations in your account against a [profile](#x2034950){: term}, you can identify potential issues as they arise.

All of the goals for {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} are added to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Best Practices Controls 1.0 profile but can also be mapped to other profiles.
{: note}

To start monitoring your resources, check out [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}](/docs/security-compliance?topic-security-compliance-getting-started).

### Available goals for {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}
{: #crypto-available-goals}

* Ensure that the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance is accessible using only private endpoints.
* Ensure that the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance contains at least the specified number of crypto units.
* Ensure that deletion of all keys in {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance requires dual authorization.
* Ensure that {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} encryption keys that are generated by the service are rotated automatically at least in the specified cadence (in months).

<!-- * Ensure that automated rotation for root keys is enabled (this lifecycle applies to {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} generated keys only).
* Ensure that deletion of all keys in {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance requires dual authorization.
* Ensure that all encryption key (root key) material is imported into the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance using an import token. 
* Ensure that {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Monitoring is enabled for all {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instances.
* Ensure that key management service has high availability. -->

This service supports the ability to view the results of your configuration scans in the {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}, as well as allowing for the enforcement of defined rules. <!-- Uncomment the following when scc templating are supported: The enforcement of some rules can require the use of **templates** to automatically assign default values to new {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} resources.-->It is not necessary to set up a collector to use configuration rules.

## Governing {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} resource configuration with config rules
{: #govern-crypto}

As a security or compliance focal, you can use the
{{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}} to
[define configuration rules](/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-rules){: external}
for the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instances that you
create.




[Config rules](#x3084914){: term}
are used to monitor and optionally enforce the configuration standards that you
want to implement across your accounts. To learn more about the
available properties that you can use to create a rule for
{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}, review the following table.

| Resource Kind | Property Name | Operator | Value | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----- | ----------- |
| `instance` | `allowed_network`| `string_equals` | public-and-private<br>private-only | Specifies the type of endpoint the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance can be accessed from. Refer to <br>[Managing network access policies](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-managing-network-access-policies) for more information. |

<!-- | `instance` | `dual_auth_delete`| `is_true`<br>`is_false` | n/a | Require/Disallow enablement of dual authorization to delete keys in the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance.

| `instance` | `key_create_and_import.create_standard_key` | `is_true`<br>`is_false` | n/a | Allow/Disallow standard keys to be created in the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance.
