# Rotating master keys
{: #rotate-master-key-cli}

You need to rotate the master key for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance on a regular basis to meet industry standards and cryptographic best practices. You can rotate your master key on demand by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} TKE CLI plug-in.
{: shortdesc}

Before you start rotating the master key, make sure that you understand {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} concepts, such as [master keys](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts#master-key-concept), [master key parts](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts#master-key-part-concept), and [signature keys](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts#signature-key-concept), and understand [how a master key is rotated](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-key-rotation#how-master-key-rotation-works) .

After the master key is rotated, all root keys encrypted by the current master key are to be reencrypted by the same new master key. For a successful master key rotation, make sure to configure all crypto units in the service instance exactly the same.Â 

## Before you begin
{: #rotate-master-key-cli-prerequisites}

Before you start, make sure that you have done the following:

1. [Install the TKE CLI and set the environment variable CLOUDTKEFILES on your workstation](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm#initialize-crypto-prerequisites).
2. Check and make sure that the current master key register is in `Valid` state with [the current master key loaded](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm#load-master-keys), the new master key register is empty, and the crypto units of the service instance are not in [imprint mode](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-understand-concepts#imprint-mode-concept) by running the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud tke cryptounit-compare
  ```
  {: pre}
3. The new master key parts are prepared for rotation. For information on how to create a new master key part, see [Create a set of master key parts to use](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm#step4-create-master-key).
4. [Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} with the CLI](/docs/cli?topic=cli-getting-started#step3-configure-idt-env){: external}. If you have multiple accounts, select the account that your service instance is created with. Make sure that you're logged in to the correct region and resource group where the service instance locates with the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud target -r <region> -g <resource_group>
  ```
  {: pre}

  To find out the regions that {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} supports, see [Regions and locations](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-regions).

## Rotating master keys
{: #rotate-master-key-cli-steps}

To rotate the master key, follow these steps:

1. Load the new master key parts to the new master key register with the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud tke cryptounit-mk-load
  ```
  {: pre}

  To load a master key register, all master key part files and signature key files to be used must be present on a common workstation. If the files were created on separate workstations, make sure that the file names are different to avoid collision. The master key part file owners and signature key file owners need to enter the file passwords when the master key register is loaded on the common workstation.

  A list of the master key parts that are found on the workstation is displayed.

  When prompted, enter the master key parts to be loaded into the new master key register, the password for the signature key file to be used, and password for each selected key part file sequentially.

  The new master key is now in `Full uncommited` state in the new master key register.

  To load a new master key, you need to enter at least two master key parts. Make sure that at least one master key part is not used for the current master key. Otherwise, the same master key is generated and you are not able to load it to the new master key register.
  {: important}

2. Commit the new master key with the following command:

  ```
  ibmcloud tke cryptounit-mk-commit
  ```
  {: pre}

  When prompted, enter the passwords for the signature key files to be used.

  The new master key is now in `Full commited` state in the new master key register.

3. If you have any encryption keys that are encrypted with the current master key using the GREP11 API and are not stored in the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} keystore, call the [RewrapKeyBlob GREP11 API](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grep11-api-ref#grep11-rewrapKeyBlob) to reencrypt the keys with the new master key.

  Make sure to perform this step before you rotate the master key. Otherwise, your keys that are encrypted with the current master key cannot be reencrypted and used.
  {: important}

  For an introduction to the GREP11 API, see [Introducing EP11 over gRPC](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grep11_intro). You can also find code examples on the GREP11 API usage in [GitHub](https://github.com/ibm-developer/ibm-cloud-hyperprotectcrypto){: external}.

4. Rotate the current master key with the new master key and reencrypt the root keys that are managed by performing the following steps:

  1. Start master key rotation by running the following command:

    ```
    ibmcloud tke cryptounit-mk-rotate
    ```
    {: pre}

    If you accidentally cancelled this command, you can rerun it at any point.
    {: tip}

  2. When prompted, type `y` to proceed with the pre-check.

    The following settings are checked:
    * Only one service instance is selected and all cryto units from that service instance are select.
    * All select crypto units leave imprint mode and have the same signature threshold.
    * The selected administrators match the administrators installed in the crypto units.
    * All crypto units have the new and current key registers configured correctly.

  3. To complete master key rotation and activate the new master key, enter the password for the signature key file to be used when prompted.

    You must enter the password for the current signature key file when prompted. Otherwise, your service instance is not usable.
    {: important}

    It might take approximately 60 seconds to reencrypt 3000 root keys. When the master key is being rotated, you cannot perform any key-related actions except for deleting keys.
    {: note}

    A success message is displayed when the master key rotation is completed.

    The new master key is now in `Valid` state in the current master key register. Check out [Master key rotation](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-key-rotation#how-master-key-rotation-works) for information on how the key states change.

You have successfully rotated the currently master key with the new master key. Your root keys and encryption keys are now well-protected by the new master key.
