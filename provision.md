## Provisioning from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console
{: #provision-gui}

To provision an instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, complete the following steps:

1. [Log in to your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: new_window}.
2. Click **Catalog** to view the list of services that are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
3. From the All Categories navigation pane, click the **Security and Identity** category.
4. From the list of services, click the **{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}** tile.
5. **Optional**: In the **Tags** field, add tags to organize your resources. If your tags are billing related, consider writing tags as key:value pairs to help group related tags, such as `costctr:124`. For more information on tags, see [Working with tags](/docs/resources?topic=resources-tag#tag).
6. Under **Number of crypto units**, select the number of  crypto units that meets your performance needs.

1. Download and install the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli/index.html#overview){: new_window} with the following command:

    ```sh
    curl -sl https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    {: pre}

    **Notes:** For more information about the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI, see [Getting started with the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI](/docs/cli/index.html#overview){: new_window}.

2. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} through the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI with the following command:

    ```
    {: pre}

3. Provision an instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} within that account and resource group.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-instance-create <instance_name> kms tiered-pricing
    ```
    {: pre}

    Replace `<instance_name>` with a unique alias for your service instance.
