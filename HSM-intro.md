# Introducing cloud HSM and EP11 over gRPC
{: #HSM-overview}

Hardware security module (HSM) is a physical device that safeguards and manages digital keys for strong authentication and provides crypto-processing. HSMs protect the cryptographic infrastructure by securely managing, storing, and protecting cryptographic keys inside a tamper-resistant device.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} is a cloud-based, FIPS 140-2 Level 4 certified HSM. With the support of Bring Your Own Key (BYOK), {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} acts as a dedicated key management service to provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic keys. The customer-controlled {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} HSM backbones the key management service through the Keep Your Own Key (KYOK) support and [master key](#x2908413){: term} protection with the highest level of security for cryptography. It guarantees that no one, including cloud admins, has access to your keys. In order to use {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} to protect your keys and data, you need to first load the master key parts to the HSM. For more information, see [Introduction to service instance initialization](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-introduce-service). For a detailed procedure, see [Initializing service instances](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-initialize-hsm).

With the introduction of Enterprise PKCS#11 (EP11) over [gRPC](https://grpc.io){: external}, you can also leverage the cloud HSM of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} to access a full range of cryptographic operations to your sensitive data. The cryptographic operations include signing, signature validation, message authentication codes, random number generation.

## Introduction to EP11 over gRPC
{: #grep11_intro}

EP11 is designed for customers that are seeking support for open standards and enhanced security. The EP11 library provides a stateless interface, which is similar to the industry-standard [Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #11 API](http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html){: external}. PKCS #11 API defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules (HSM) and smart cards. Existing applications that use PKCS #11 can benefit from enhanced security with secure key cryptography as well as stateless interface, which makes the cryptographic operations much more efficient.

More information about the EP11 Library can be found in the [Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) Library structure document](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc4/EP11/docs/ep11-structure.pdf){: external}. For more information about EP11 capabilities and extensions, see [EP11 introduction](https://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc3/software#1062266){: external}.

{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} provides a set of EP11 APIs over gRPC calls, with which all the cryptographic functions are executed in the HSM of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. EP11 over gRPC is a stateless interface for cryptographic operations on cloud.

{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} leverages frameworks such as gRPC to enable remote application access. gRPC is a modern open source high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can connect services in and across data centers for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication. Applications access {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} by calling the EP11 API remotely through gRPC. For more information about gRPC, see [the gRPC documentation](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html){: external}.

With the GREP11 APIs, you can perform the following operations:

- Key generation.
- Encrypt and decrypt.
- Sign and verify.
- Wrap and unwrap keys.
- Derive keys.
- Build message digest.
- Retrieve mechanism information.

For each operation, there are a series of suboperations. For example, the `Encrypt` operation is composed of `EncryptInit()`, `Encrypt()`, `EncryptUpdate()`, `EncryptFinal()`, and `EncryptSingle()` suboperations.

- `EncryptInit()` is used to initialize an operation.
- `Encrypt()` is used to encrypt data without the need to perform `EncryptUpdate()` and `EncryptFinal()` suboperations. This suboperation needs to be performed after the `EncryptInit()` call.
- `EncryptUpdate()` and `EncryptFinal()` are used in combination to perform data encryption. These suboperations need to be performed after the `EncryptInit()` call.
- `EncryptSingle()` is an IBM EP11 extension to the standard PKCS#11 specification, and is used to perform a single call to encrypt data without the need to run the `EncryptInit()`, `Encrypt()`, `EncryptUpdate()`, or `EncryptFinal()` sub-operation.

The following table shows the implemented functions in EP11 over gRPC, and how the functions are related to PKCS #11 and EP11. For more information on the GREP11 API, see [GREP11 API reference](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grep11-api-ref).

PKCS #11 functions that are marked with an asterisk (*) in the table are implemented by EP11 over gRPC. Others are not implemented.
