# Restoring keys
{: #restore-keys}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} to restore a previously deleted root key and access its associated data on the cloud.
{: shortdesc}

As an admin, you might need to restore a root key that you import to {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} so that you can access data that the key previously protect. When you restore a key, you move the key from the _Destroyed_ to the _Active_ key state, and you restore access to any data that is previously encrypted with the key.

You can restore a deleted key within 30 days of its deletion. This capability is available only for root keys that are previously imported to the service. You can't restore root keys that are generated by {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
{: note}

<!--
## How do I know whether a key can be restored?
{: #restore-keys-eligibility}

To see whether a destroyed key can be restored:

1. Navigate to your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
2. In the left navigation, make sure you are on the **Key management service keys** page.
3. Find the key you want to restore and make sure the key is in a **Destroyed** state.
4. Under the **Last updated** column, note the date and check whether the key has been deleted within the last 30 days. If it has been more then 30 days, you will not be able to restore the key. If you attempt to restore a key that is no longer eligible to be restored, you will receive an error when trying to restore the key.
-->

## Restoring a deleted key with the console
{: #restore-keys-ui}
{: help}
{: support}

If you prefer to restore your root key by using a graphical interface, you can use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

Complete the following steps to restore the key:

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/){: external}.
2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.
3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
4. On the **Key management service keys** page, click **Restore Key** to open a side panel.
5. Enter the key ID and the key material of the key that you want to restore, and click **Restore**.

  Make sure you save the key ID and the key material before you restore the key.
  {: note}

6. Confirm the key is restored in the updated **Keys** table.

## Restoring a deleted key with the API
{: #restore-keys-api}

Restore a key by making a `POST` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/restore
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-set-up-kms-api).

    To restore a key, you must be assigned a _Manager_ access policy for the instance or key. To learn how IAM roles map to {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} service actions, check out [Service access roles](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-manage-access#service-access-roles).
    {: note}

2. Retrieve the key management API endpoint URL.

    You can get the API endpoint from your provisioned service instance dashboard through **Overview** &gt; **Connect** &gt; **Key management endpoint URL**. Or, you can dynamically [retrieve the API endpoint URL](/apidocs/hs-crypto#getinstance){: external} with an API call. Select the public or private key manage endpoint URL based on your needs.

3. Retrieve the ID of the key that you want to restore.

    You can retrieve the ID for a specified key by making a [list keys API request](/apidocs/hs-crypto#getkeys){: external}, or by viewing your keys in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.

4. Run the following `curl` command to restore the key and regain access to its associated data. Note that you must wait 30 seconds after deleting a key before you are able to restore it.

   You cannot restore a key that has an expiration date that is current or in the past.

        Table 1. Describes the variables that are needed to restore keys with the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} API.
      </caption>
    </table>

    A successful restore request returns an HTTP `201 Created` response, which indicates that the key was restored to the _Active_ key state and is now available for encrypt and decrypt operations. All attributes and policies that were previously associated with the key are also restored.

    You will have access to data associated with the key as soon as the key is restored.
    {: note}

5. Optional: Verify that the key was restored by retrieving details about the key.

    ```sh
    curl -X GET \
      "https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_id>/metadata" \
      -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>' \
      -H 'bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>' \
      -H 'accept: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json'
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    Where the `<key_id>` is the ID of the key, the `<instance_ID>` is the name of your instance, and your `<IAM_token>` is your IAM token.

    Review the `state` field in the response body to verify that the key transitioned to the _Active_ key state. The following JSON output shows the metadata details for an _Active_ key.

    The integer mapping for the _Active_ key state is 1. Key states are based on NIST SP 800-57.

### Using an import token to restore a key
{: #restore-keys-secure-api}

If you initially used an import token to import the root key, you can restore the key by making a `POST` call to the following endpoint.

```
https://api.<region>.hs-crypto.cloud.ibm.com:<port>/api/v2/keys/<key_ID>/restore
```
{: codeblock}

1. [Retrieve your authentication credentials to work with keys in the service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-set-up-kms-api#retrieve-kms-credentials).

    To restore a key, you must be assigned a _Manager_ service access role for the instance or key. To learn how IAM roles map to {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} service actions, check out [Service access roles](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-manage-access#service-access-roles).
    {: note}

2. Retrieve the key management API endpoint URL.

    You can get the API endpoint from your provisioned service instance dashboard by clicking **Manage** &gt; **Key management endpoint URL**, or you can dynamically [retrieve the API endpoint URL](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/hs-crypto#getinstance){: external} with an API call. Select the public or private key manage endpoint URL based on your needs.

3. Retrieve the ID of the key that you want to restore.

    You can retrieve the ID for a specified key by making a [list keys API request](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/hs-crypto#getkeys){: external}, or by viewing your keys in the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} dashboard.
