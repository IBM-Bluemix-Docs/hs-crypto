# Viewing associations between root keys and encrypted {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resources
{: #view-protected-resources}

You can view associations between root keys and other cloud resources, such as {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} buckets, by using the {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key management API.
{: shortdesc}

When you use a root key to protect at-rest data with envelope encryption, the cloud services that use the key can create a registration between the key and the resource that it protects. Registrations are associations between keys and cloud resources that help you get a full view of which encryption keys protect what data on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.


| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Centralized view of protected resources | As an administrator for your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} instance, you want to quickly understand which cloud resources are protected by a root key. |
| Security and compliance | As a security admin, you need a way to determine the risk that's involved with [destroying a root key](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-delete-keys). You want to examine which keys are actively protecting what data so that you can evaluate exposures based on your organization's security or compliance needs. |
{: caption="Table 1. Describes the benefits of key registration" caption-side="top"}

Key registration is an extra feature that's available only if the cloud service enables it as part of its integration with {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}. To determine whether an [integrated service](/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-integrate-services) supports key registration, refer to its service documentation for more information.

<!-- ## Viewing protected resources with the GUI
{: #view-protected-resources-gui}

You can browse the registrations that are available between your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} keys and cloud resources by using the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} GUI.

### Viewing resources for a specific root key with the GUI
{: #view-protected-resources-key-id-gui}

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.
3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
4. On the application details page, use the **Keys** table to browse the keys in your service.
5. To view the protected resoures of a specific root key or standard key, click the overflow (â‹¯) icon to open a list of options for the key, and select **View associated resources**.
  A list of resources that are protected by the selected key is displayed.
6. To view details of each resource, expand the resource details by clicking the caret (^) icon.

  The following table describes the registration details.

| Field | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `Created` | The date and time that the resource was first associated with the key. |
| `Last updated` | The date and time that the registration was updated. |
| `Description` | A description of the registration. |
| `Key version ID` | The version of the root key that's protecting the  cloud resource. |
| `Key version date` | The date and time that the root key version was updated. |
| `Cloud resource name` | The Cloud Resource Name (CRN) that represents the cloud resource, such as a Cloud Object Storage bucket, that is associated with the key. |
{: caption="Table 2. Properties that are associated with a resource" caption-side="top"}

  You can use the search field to search for any resources associated with the root key either with the resource name or the key version ID.
  {: tip}

### Viewing resources for any root keys with the GUI
{: #view-protected-resources-any-key-gui}

1. [Log in to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://cloud.ibm.com/login){: external}.
2. Go to **Menu** &gt; **Resource List** to view a list of your resources.
3. From your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource list, select your provisioned instance of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}.
4. On the application details page, select **Associated Resources** on the navigation pane.
5. On the **Associated resources** page, use the **Associated Resources** table to browse the registrations in your service.
5. Click the caret (^) icon under the `Details` column to view a list of details for a specific registration.
7. Click `Filter` button to filter for resources by key ID, Cloud Resource Name
(CRN), and retention policy.

## Viewing protected resources with the API
{: #view-protected-resources-api}

You can also browse the registrations that are available between your {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} keys and cloud resources by using the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key management API.

For example, when you call `GET api/v2/keys/{id}/registrations`, {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} returns details about the key registration. The following JSON output represents a registration between a key and a cloud resource.
```
{
  "metadata": {
      "collectionType": "application/vnd.ibm.kms.registration+json",
      "collectionTotal": 1
  },
  "resources": [
    {
      "keyId": "string",
      "resourceCrn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:<service-name>:<region>:a/<account-id>:<service-instance>:bucket:<bucket-name>",
      "createdBy": "string",
      "creationDate": "2010-01-12T05:23:19+0000",
      "updatedBy": "string",
      "lastUpdated": "2010-01-12T05:23:19+0000",
      "description": "string",
      "preventKeyDeletion": true,
      "keyVersion": {
          "id": "string",
          "creationDate": "2010-01-12T05:23:19+0000"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
{: screen}

The following table describes the properties of a registration.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `keyID` | The ID that identifies the root key that is associated with the cloud resource. |
| `resourceCrn` | The Cloud Resource Name (CRN) that represents the cloud resource, such as a Cloud Object Storage bucket, that is associated with the key. |
| `createdBy` | The unique identifier for the resource that created the registration. |
| `creationDate` | The date the registration was created. |
| `updatedBy` | The unique identifier for the resource that updated the registration. |
| `lastUpdatedDate` | The date the registration was created. |
| `description` | A description for the registration.|
| `preventKeyDeletion` | A boolean that determines whether {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} must prevent deletion of the root key. If `true`, the associated resource is non-erasable due to a retention policy, and the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key that is encrypting the resource cannot be deleted. |
| `keyVersion` | The version of the root key that's protecting the cloud resource.|

#### CRN query examples
{: #crn-query-examples}

Use URL encoded CRN queries that contain all CRN segments. To learn more about CRN segments and format, see [Cloud Resource Names](/docs/resources?topic=resources-crn).

When an integrated service calls the {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} key management APIs, {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} replaces the given CRN query (up to the `service-instance` segment) with the CRN of the calling service. This means that the services that use {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} to associate keys with resources on your behalf can only view or query for CRNs that match the first 8 segments of their service CRN.
{: note}

- To search for the existence of a CRN segment, use a colon followed by an asterisk (`*`).

    ```
    crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-redis:us-south:a/274074dce64e9c423ffc238516c755e1:29caf0e7-120f-4da8-9551-3abf57ebcfc7:*:*
    ```
    {: screen}

    This query returns Databases for Redis registrations that are associated with all resource types and names for deployment ID _29caf0e7-120f-4da8-9551-3abf57ebcfc7_.


- To search for a CRN segment that's prefixed by `<string>`, use a colon followed by `<string>*` on the last segment of the CRN query.

  ```
  crn:v1:bluemix:public:cloud-object-storage:global:a/e1bb63d6a20dc57c87501ac4c4c99dcb:*:bucket:prod*
  ```
  {: screen}
  This query returns all Cloud Object Storage bucket registrations within account _e1bb63d6a20dc57c87501ac4c4c99dcb_ that are prefixed by `prod`.

  ```
  crn:v1:bluemix:public:databases-for-postgresql:us-south:a/e1bb63d6a20dc57c87501ac4c4c99dcb:76b98bfd-f730-47b8-b163-515187e070a7:*:<string>*
  ```
  {: screen}
  This query returns all Cloud Databases registrations for deployment ID _76b98bfd-f730-47b8-b163-515187e070a7_ that are prefixed by `<string>`.
