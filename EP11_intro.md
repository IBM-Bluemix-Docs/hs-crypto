# Enterprise PKCS #11 of {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}}
{: #enterprise_PKCS11_overview}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} provides the cloud cryptography capability by allowing users to access Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) cryptography library over [gRPC](https://grpc.io){: external} (also referred to as *GREP11*) API calls.
{: shortdesc}

## Introduction to EP11 and PKCS #11
{: #ep11-pkcs11-intro}

EP11 is specifically designed for customers seeking support for open standards and enhanced security. The EP11 library provides a stateless interface, which is similar to the industry-standard [Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #11 API](http://docs.oasis-open.org/pkcs11/pkcs11-base/v2.40/os/pkcs11-base-v2.40-os.html){: external}.

PKCS #11 API defines a platform-independent API to cryptographic tokens, such as hardware security modules (HSM) and smart cards. Existing applications using PKCS #11 will benefit from enhanced security using secure key cryptography as well as stateless interface, which makes the cryptographic operations much more efficient.

More information about the EP11 Library can be found in the [Enterprise PKCS #11 (EP11) Library structure document](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/WXRDPRAN){: external}. For details about EP11 capabilities and extensions, see [EP11 introduction](https://www.ibm.com/security/cryptocards/pciecc3/software#1062266){: external}.

## Introduction to EP11 over gRPC
{: #grep11_intro}

{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} provides a set of EP11 APIs over gRPC calls, with which all the Crypto functions are executed in a Hardware Security Module (HSM) on the cloud. EP11 over gRPC is designed to be a stateless interface for cryptographic operations on cloud.

{{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} leverages frameworks such as gRPC to enable remote application access. gRPC is a modern open source high performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework that can connect services in and across data centers for load balancing, tracing, health checking, and authentication. Applications access {{site.data.keyword.hscrypto}} by calling the EP11 API remotely through gRPC. For more information on gRPC, see [the gRPC documentaion](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html){: external}.

With the GREP11 APIs, you can perform the following operations:

- Key generation
- Encrypt and decrypt
- Sign and verify
- Wrap and unwrap keys
- Derive keys
- Build message digest
- Retrieve mechanism information

For each operation, there are a series of suboperations. For example, the `Encrypt` operation is composed of `EncryptInit()`, `Encrypt()`, `EncryptUpdate()`, `EncryptFinal()`, and `EncryptSingle()` suboperations.

- `EncryptInit()` is used to initialize an operation.
- `Encrypt()` is used to encrypt data without the need to perform `EncryptUpdate()` and `EncryptFinal()` suboperations. This suboperation needs to be performed after the `EncryptInit()` call.
- `EncryptUpdate()` and `EncryptFinal()` are used in combination to perform data encryption. These suboperations need to be performed after the `EncryptInit()` call.  
- `EncryptSingle()` is an IBM EP11 extension to the standard PKCS#11 specification, and is used to perform a single call to encrypt data without the need to run the `EncryptInit()`, `Encrypt()`, `EncryptUpdate()`, or `EncryptFinal()` sub-operation.

The following table shows the implemented functions in EP11 over gRPC, and how the functions are related to PKCS #11 and EP11. For more information on the GREP11 API, see [GREP11 API reference](/docs/services/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-grep11-api-ref).

PKCS #11 functions that are marked with an asterisk (*) in the table are implemented by EP11 over gRPC. Others are not implemented.
